// RefCell<T>  the borrowed rules will be checked at runtime,if break,  will case panic.
// The RefCell<T> type is useful when youâ€™re sure your code follows the borrowing rules 
// but the compiler is unable to understand and guarantee that. 

// Here is a recap of the reasons to choose Box<T>, Rc<T>, or RefCell<T>:
// Rc<T> enables multiple owners of the same data; Box<T> and RefCell<T> have single owners.
// Box<T> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; Rc<T> allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; RefCell<T> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
// Because RefCell<T> allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can mutate the value inside the RefCell<T> even when the RefCell<T> is immutable.
